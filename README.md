# Dear Fiftythree,

I had fun engaging in this challenge and while at points I was a little stressed about time and getting the minor functionality to work,
I enjoyed thinking through the flow of components and how to get rid of the modals! 

A few notes:

- The Pure JS challenge is in the file described: javascript_challenge.js, this file sits outside of the folder housing the react project 

- I would have loved to build out tests for this project so that as it gets bigger or if it gets refactored, I can still make sure my product works.

- Currently I have an 'a' set of componenets and a 'b' set of components. This enabled linear flow for my thinking and testing functionality
However moving forward I would like to refactor so that I am not repeating functions and/or building logic so that I can make better use of conditionals and inheritance

- It always pains me a little bit when the visual design of my app is a bit heavy and clumsy. Alas, I am not a graphic designer. 
Given time I would have loved to tinker with layout, visual design, and hopefully have the advice and help of someone FAR better at intuitive css than me and build a more visually appealing page!

- Particularly would have loved to use some chrome dev tools to find the exact peach color of my nav bar and buttons and make my modal pop out also in that color!

- Did not use Redux for this particular challenge as that usually have a much longer layout/set up time. However tracking state and the 
implementation of modals would be a little but more seamless with redux and would enable a larger more multiplicitious build out.
